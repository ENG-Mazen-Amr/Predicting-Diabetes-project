# Predicting-Diabetes-project
🔬 Project Overview:

I developed an AI-based application to predict the likelihood of diabetes using deep learning techniques.

💡 Project Details:

Trained a deep learning model using PyTorch on real-world data from Kaggle’s Diabetes Prediction Dataset
.

The model predicts the probability of diabetes based on 21 health and behavioral features.

A modern and user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) was built using CustomTkinter.

Users can input their data and receive instant prediction results, with the ability to save their data for future reference.

🧰 Tools & Libraries Used:

pandas, numpy: for data analysis and preprocessing

scikit-learn: for data splitting, normalization, and other preprocessing tasks

PyTorch: for designing and training the deep learning model

CustomTkinter: for building a professional and modern GUI

pickle, csv: for saving the trained model and user data

ChatGPT was used to:

Organize and refactor code

Solve certain development challenges

⭐ Key Features:

Smart feature handling (e.g., amplifying or reducing the impact of certain features based on importance)

Ability to store user input data for later analysis

Supports light and dark themes

Clean, intuitive design for an enhanced user experience
