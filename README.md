# Predicting-Diabetes-project
I worked on building an application to predict the likelihood of diabetes using artificial intelligence techniques, specifically deep learning networks. Project details: I trained a model using the PyTorch library on real data from https://www.kaggle.com/.../diabetes-prediction-dataset. The model predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on 21 health and behavioral features. A modern and user-friendly graphical user interface was developed using CustomTkinter. The user can input their data and receive the prediction result directly, with the option to save the data. I used libraries such as pandas and numpy for data analysis, scikit-learn for processing, splitting, and normalization, PyTorch for designing and training the deep model, CustomTkinter for professional user interface development, and pickle and csv for saving the model and data. I also used ChatGPT for: organizing the code and improving its structure, solving some problems. Key features: intelligent processing of some characteristics (amplifying/reducing their impact based on importance), saving user data for later analysis, support for dark and light mode, easy and smooth design for any user.
